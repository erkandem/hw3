function  helloworld( bretzels, bier, wurst)
% The mandatory Hello World Thing... You Know...
%  also, since comment symbols are ignored by sphinx "double percent" symbols could
%  be used and make files stay compatible with the MATLAB code publisher.

% :param bretzels: a snack  
% :type bretzels: carbonhydrates
%
% :param bier: beer just written in german
% :type bier: E5 fuel
%
% :param wurst: sausage, preferable barbecued
% :type wurst:  protein

% :note: bretzels, bier and wurst are not used
%        ok.. it really doesn't make sense. I just wanted
%        to create some sphinx docs via .rst docstrings =)
%
% :note: you need to a free line for above and below the statement
%        beeing developed on python, it takes note of indentation
%
% :note: if the chain of comments is intrerrupeded the sphinx is not listening 
%        anymore. See: the fourth note:
%
d =1+1;
g=5+5;
 sprintf('%s', "Hello World! I'm playing around with sterotypes")
